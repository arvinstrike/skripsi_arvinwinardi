        \textit{The advancement of \textit{deepfake} technology poses significant challenges in preserving the integrity of digital information. This study proposes a facial image \textit{deepfake} classification system using an \textit{ensemble deep learning} approach with \textit{weighted averaging}. Four individual models were employed in the ensemble: Custom CNN, ResNet50, Xception, and EfficientNet-B4. The dataset used was the \textit{140k Real and Fake Faces} from Kaggle, partitioned into 100,000 training, 20,000 validation, and 20,000 test images. Each model was trained independently and evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score. Experimental results show that the ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 96.87\%, outperforming the best individual model (Xception, 95.83\%). Cross-dataset evaluation on \textit{DeepFakeFace} demonstrated that although the accuracy dropped to 50\%, the ensemble still exhibited superior generalization performance compared to single models. This research highlights that ensemble methods with diverse architectures can enhance the accuracy and reliability of deepfake detection systems.}
