\begin{abstract}
The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has revolutionized digital media creation, enabling both beneficial applications and sophisticated manipulation techniques. Deepfake technology, utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), now produces highly realistic synthetic facial images that pose significant threats to digital information integrity and social trust. While individual deep learning models have shown promise in deepfake detection, they often suffer from limited generalization across different generation techniques and exhibit domain-specific overfitting. Here we present an ensemble weighted averaging approach that systematically combines four diverse deep learning architectures: Custom CNN, ResNet50, Xception, and EfficientNet-B4. Our method achieves 99.64\% accuracy on the 140k Real and Fake Faces dataset, representing a 0.44\% improvement over the best individual model (Xception, 99.20\%) while reducing false negatives by 78\% and false positives by 46.5\%. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals significant generalization challenges, with performance dropping to 50\% on external datasets, emphasizing the critical need for robust training strategies and diverse evaluation protocols in real-world deepfake detection systems.

\section{Introduction}

Artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies have experienced unprecedented advancement, fundamentally transforming how digital content is created, processed, and authenticated \cite{lecun2015deep}. These developments have enabled remarkable applications in entertainment, education, and digital art, while simultaneously creating new challenges for content verification and digital forensics \cite{verdoliva2020media}.

The emergence of deepfake technology represents one of the most significant challenges in this landscape. Deepfakes, synthetic media created using sophisticated machine learning techniques, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can produce highly convincing fake videos and images with unprecedented realism \cite{goodfellow2014generative}. The term "deepfake," derived from "deep learning" and "fake," encompasses various techniques for face swapping, facial reenactment, and speech synthesis. Recent advances in neural network architectures, particularly StyleGAN \cite{karras2019style} and its variants, have dramatically improved the quality of synthetic facial images, making them increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic content.

The implications of this technology extend far beyond technical capabilities. Deepfakes have been weaponized for disinformation campaigns, non-consensual intimate imagery, financial fraud, and political manipulation \cite{tolosana2020deepfakes}. The democratization of deepfake creation tools has lowered barriers to entry, enabling malicious actors with limited technical expertise to create convincing synthetic content \cite{rossler2020faceforensics}.

Current deepfake detection approaches primarily rely on individual deep learning models trained to identify specific artifacts or inconsistencies in synthetic images \cite{wang2020cnn}. However, these methods face several critical limitations. First, individual models often exhibit poor generalization across different deepfake generation techniques, as they tend to overfit to specific artifacts present in their training data \cite{dolhansky2020dfdc}. Second, the rapid evolution of generation techniques creates an arms race where detection methods quickly become obsolete when confronted with new synthesis approaches. Third, most existing detection systems are evaluated primarily on single datasets, limiting our understanding of their real-world performance and robustness.

Ensemble learning presents a promising solution to these challenges by combining multiple models with complementary strengths and error patterns \cite{dietterich2000ensemble}. The fundamental principle underlying ensemble methods is that diverse models making different types of errors can correct each other when their predictions are appropriately combined \cite{brown2005diversity}. In the context of deepfake detection, this translates to leveraging architectures that capture different aspects of synthetic artifactsâ€”spatial inconsistencies, temporal anomalies, frequency domain signatures, and compression artifacts.

Despite the theoretical appeal of ensemble methods, their application to deepfake detection remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on optimizing individual architectures rather than systematically investigating how different models can be effectively combined. This knowledge gap is particularly significant given the high-stakes nature of deepfake detection applications, where false negatives can enable the spread of malicious synthetic content, and false positives can undermine trust in legitimate media.

Here we present a comprehensive investigation of ensemble weighted averaging for deepfake detection, systematically combining four diverse deep learning architectures selected for their complementary characteristics. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in detection accuracy and error reduction while revealing important insights about generalization challenges in cross-dataset scenarios. Through rigorous evaluation on both internal and external datasets, we provide evidence for the effectiveness of ensemble methods and highlight critical considerations for real-world deployment.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Deepfake Generation Technologies}

The foundation of modern deepfake technology lies in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), introduced by Goodfellow et al. \cite{goodfellow2014generative}. The adversarial training framework, where a generator network competes against a discriminator network, has proven remarkably effective for generating realistic synthetic content. Subsequent developments, including StyleGAN \cite{karras2019style}, have significantly improved the quality and controllability of generated faces.

Face swap techniques have evolved from simple feature replacement to sophisticated neural rendering approaches. DeepFakes, Face2Face \cite{thies2016face2face}, and FaceSwapper represent different paradigms in facial manipulation, each leaving distinct artifacts that detection systems attempt to exploit. The introduction of few-shot and one-shot learning methods has further reduced the data requirements for creating convincing deepfakes \cite{zakharov2019few}.

\subsection{Individual Model Approaches}

Early deepfake detection methods relied on hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning classifiers. The transition to deep learning-based approaches has dominated recent research, with various CNN architectures showing promising results. XceptionNet has emerged as a particularly effective architecture for deepfake detection, leveraging depthwise separable convolutions to capture spatial inconsistencies \cite{rossler2020faceforensics}.

Recent work has explored specialized architectures for deepfake detection. Wang et al. \cite{wang2023si} developed Si-Net, achieving 94.54\% accuracy on FaceForensics++ through spatial inconsistency analysis. Zhao et al. \cite{zhao2023istvt} proposed ISTVT, combining Xception with Transformer architectures for improved temporal consistency analysis. 

Transfer learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in adapting pre-trained models to deepfake detection tasks. However, many individual model approaches suffer from dataset-specific overfitting and limited cross-domain generalization \cite{cozzolino2023audio}.

\subsection{Ensemble Methods in Computer Vision}

Ensemble learning has a rich history in machine learning, with theoretical foundations established by Dietterich \cite{dietterich2000ensemble} and practical implementations across various domains. In computer vision, ensemble methods have proven effective for image classification \cite{he2016deep} and medical image analysis \cite{esteva2017dermatologist}.

The success of ensemble methods relies on diversity among base learners, which can be achieved through different architectures, training procedures, or data representations \cite{kuncheva2003measures}. Weighted averaging represents one of the simplest yet effective ensemble strategies, particularly when base learners exhibit varying performance levels.

\subsection{Ensemble Approaches in Deepfake Detection}

Despite the proven effectiveness of ensemble methods in other domains, their application to deepfake detection remains limited. Most existing research focuses on single model optimization rather than systematic model combination. The lack of comprehensive ensemble studies in deepfake detection represents a significant gap in the literature, particularly given the diverse nature of deepfake artifacts that could benefit from multi-model approaches.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset Selection and Characteristics}

The selection of an appropriate dataset is crucial for developing robust deepfake detection systems. We utilized the "140k Real and Fake Faces" dataset from Kaggle, which provides a balanced collection of 70,000 authentic facial images sourced from Flickr and 70,000 synthetic images generated using StyleGAN. This dataset was chosen for several reasons: (1) balanced class distribution eliminating bias concerns, (2) consistent image quality and resolution (256Ã—256 pixels), (3) diversity in facial characteristics and demographics, and (4) clear generation methodology enabling controlled evaluation.

The dataset was partitioned using stratified sampling to maintain class balance across subsets: 100,000 images for training (71.4\%), 20,000 for validation (14.3\%), and 20,000 for testing (14.3\%). This division ensures adequate data for model training while providing statistically significant validation and test sets for reliable performance assessment.

\subsection{Preprocessing Pipeline}

The preprocessing pipeline was designed to preserve forensically relevant artifacts while enabling effective neural network training. Pixel normalization scaled values from [0,255] to [0,1] range, providing numerical stability during gradient-based optimization. Augmentation was deliberately minimized to preserve subtle artifacts that may be crucial for detection. Only horizontal flipping was applied to training data, as more aggressive transformations (rotation, scaling, color jittering) could potentially destroy or introduce artifacts that confound the detection task.

The conservative preprocessing approach reflects the unique requirements of forensic applications, where maintaining signal integrity is paramount. This contrasts with typical computer vision applications where aggressive augmentation often improves generalization. Recent work by Peng et al. \cite{peng2024artifacts} demonstrates that generic augmentations often yield limited improvements for forgery detection, advocating instead for specialized augmentations that amplify deepfake artifacts, which validates our minimal augmentation strategy.

\subsection{Individual Model Architectures}

\subsubsection{Custom CNN Design}

The Custom CNN was specifically designed for deepfake detection, incorporating domain knowledge about the hierarchical nature of visual artifacts. The architecture features four convolutional blocks with progressively increasing filter counts (32â†’64â†’128â†’256), enabling the extraction of features from low-level edge patterns to high-level semantic inconsistencies.

Each convolutional block consists of two 3Ã—3 convolution layers followed by max pooling (2Ã—2) and dropout (0.25). This design facilitates gradual spatial downsampling while building increasingly complex feature representations. The fully connected layers (512â†’128â†’1 neurons) include batch normalization and dropout (0.5) for regularization, culminating in a sigmoid activation for binary classification.

The architectural choices were motivated by the need to detect subtle inconsistencies at multiple spatial scales, from pixel-level compression artifacts to region-level semantic inconsistencies that characterize deepfake content.

\subsubsection{Transfer Learning Models}

\textbf{ResNet50:} Pre-trained on ImageNet, ResNet50 provides deep feature extraction through residual connections that enable training of very deep networks \cite{he2016deep}. The first 100 layers were frozen to preserve low-level feature extractors, while later layers were fine-tuned with a reduced learning rate ($5 \times 10^{-5}$) to adapt to deepfake-specific patterns.

\textbf{Xception:} The Xception architecture employs depthwise separable convolutions, which separately process spatial and channel-wise correlations \cite{chollet2017xception}. This separation is particularly relevant for deepfake detection, as synthetic artifacts may manifest differently across color channels and spatial locations. The efficiency of depthwise separable convolutions also enables processing of high-resolution inputs with reasonable computational overhead.

\textbf{EfficientNet-B4:} EfficientNet's compound scaling methodology systematically balances network depth, width, and input resolution \cite{tan2019efficientnet}. This balanced scaling is advantageous for deepfake detection, where optimal performance may require careful consideration of all architectural dimensions to capture multi-scale artifacts effectively.

\subsection{Ensemble Weighted Averaging}

The ensemble methodology combines predictions from all four models using weighted averaging, where weights reflect individual model performance on validation data. This approach is theoretically grounded in the principle that models with superior validation performance should contribute more significantly to final decisions.

The ensemble prediction is computed as:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_{ensemble}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot \hat{y}_i(x)
\end{equation}

where weights are calculated based on validation accuracy:
\begin{equation}
w_i = \frac{\text{accuracy}_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \text{accuracy}_j}
\end{equation}

This weighting scheme ensures that the ensemble automatically adapts to the relative strengths of individual models while maintaining contributions from all models to preserve diversity. The normalization constraint ($\sum w_i = 1$) ensures that ensemble outputs remain within valid probability bounds.

The weighted averaging approach was selected over more complex ensemble methods (stacking, boosting) for several reasons: (1) computational efficiency during inference, (2) interpretability of individual model contributions \cite{mansoor2025explainable}, (3) stability across different validation sets, and (4) reduced risk of overfitting compared to learned combination functions.

\subsection{Training Configuration and Optimization}

All models were trained using the Adam optimizer, selected for its adaptive learning rate properties and robust performance across diverse architectures. Learning rates were differentiated based on initialization strategy: $1 \times 10^{-4}$ for the Custom CNN (trained from scratch) and $5 \times 10^{-5}$ for transfer learning models (fine-tuning pre-trained weights).

Binary cross-entropy loss was employed for all models, providing probabilistic outputs suitable for ensemble combination. Training was conducted for a maximum of 15 epochs with early stopping (patience=3) to prevent overfitting while ensuring convergence. ModelCheckpoint callbacks saved the best model weights based on validation loss.

Batch sizes were set to 32 for training and 16 for validation, balancing computational efficiency with gradient estimation quality. All training was conducted on Google Colab Pro+ with GPU acceleration (NVIDIA A100/V100) to ensure reproducible results and reasonable training times.

\section{Experimental Results}

\subsection{Individual Model Performance Analysis}

The performance of individual models revealed interesting insights about architecture suitability for deepfake detection. Table \ref{tab:detailed_individual_results} presents comprehensive metrics for all models.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Detailed Individual Model Performance Metrics}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Acc.} & \textbf{Prec.} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{F1} & \textbf{Epochs} \\
\midrule
Custom CNN & 98.81\% & 99.02\% & 98.60\% & 98.81\% & 12 \\
ResNet50 & 90.10\% & 86.49\% & 95.03\% & 90.56\% & 11 \\
Xception & 99.20\% & 98.87\% & 99.54\% & 99.20\% & 9 \\
EfficientNet-B4 & 96.35\% & 96.47\% & 96.22\% & 96.35\% & 14 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:detailed_individual_results}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Xception achieved the highest individual performance, reaching convergence rapidly (9 epochs) while maintaining excellent precision-recall balance. The Custom CNN's competitive performance (98.81\%) demonstrates the value of domain-specific architectural design, particularly noteworthy given its training from scratch versus transfer learning approaches.

ResNet50's suboptimal performance (90.10\%) likely results from architectural complexity poorly suited to the specific characteristics of deepfake artifacts. The high recall (95.03\%) but low precision (86.49\%) suggests a tendency toward false positive predictions, indicating oversensitivity to benign variations in authentic images.

EfficientNet-B4 showed balanced performance (96.35\%) with stable training requiring the full 14 epochs for convergence. The balanced precision-recall trade-off suggests effective multi-scale feature extraction suitable for detecting diverse artifact types.

\subsection{Ensemble Performance and Error Analysis}

The weighted ensemble demonstrated superior performance across all evaluation metrics, as shown in Table \ref{tab:comprehensive_ensemble_results}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Comprehensive Ensemble Performance Analysis}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{F1-Score} \\
\midrule
Best Individual & 99.20\% & 98.87\% & 99.54\% & 99.20\% \\
\textbf{Ensemble} & \textbf{99.64\%} & \textbf{99.39\%} & \textbf{99.90\%} & \textbf{99.65\%} \\
\midrule

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:comprehensive_ensemble_results}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The ensemble weights were calculated as: Custom CNN (0.257), Xception (0.258), EfficientNet-B4 (0.251), and ResNet50 (0.234). Despite ResNet50's lower individual performance, its inclusion with reduced weight still contributed to ensemble effectiveness, supporting the diversity principle in ensemble learning.

Detailed error analysis revealed significant improvements in both error types:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{False Negatives:} Reduced from 46 (Xception) to 10 (Ensemble) - 78\% reduction
\item \textbf{False Positives:} Reduced from 114 (Xception) to 61 (Ensemble) - 46.5\% reduction
\end{itemize}

This error reduction pattern indicates that the ensemble effectively addresses different failure modes of individual models, with particularly strong improvement in reducing missed deepfakes (false negatives).

\subsection{Cross-Dataset Generalization Assessment}

To evaluate real-world applicability, we conducted cross-dataset evaluation using the DeepFakeFace dataset, which contains deepfakes generated using different techniques than the training data. Results revealed dramatic performance degradation across all models:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Cross-Dataset Performance Evaluation}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Internal Acc.} & \textbf{External Acc.} & \textbf{Degradation} \\
\midrule
Custom CNN & 98.81\% & 49.96\% & -48.85\% \\
ResNet50 & 90.10\% & 50.00\% & -40.10\% \\
Xception & 99.20\% & 49.96\% & -49.24\% \\
EfficientNet-B4 & 96.35\% & 49.92\% & -46.43\% \\
\textbf{Ensemble} & \textbf{99.64\%} & \textbf{50.00\%} & \textbf{-49.64\%} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:cross_dataset_results}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The uniform degradation to approximately 50\% accuracy (equivalent to random guessing) across all models, including the ensemble, indicates severe domain overfitting. This finding highlights a critical limitation in current deepfake detection approaches and emphasizes the importance of diverse training data for robust real-world performance. Recent work by Amin et al. \cite{amin2024svft} demonstrates that multi-domain approaches incorporating both spatial and frequency-domain features can achieve improved cross-dataset generalization (80.63\% accuracy on held-out datasets), suggesting that hybrid feature representations may help address these generalization challenges.

\subsection{Computational Efficiency Analysis}

While ensemble methods provide accuracy benefits, computational overhead must be considered for practical deployment. Our ensemble requires approximately 4Ã— the inference time of individual models, with memory requirements scaling proportionally. However, the significant reduction in critical errors (false negatives) may justify this overhead in security-sensitive applications where the cost of missed detections is high.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Ensemble Effectiveness and Model Complementarity}

The success of weighted averaging ensemble demonstrates the effectiveness of combining diverse architectures for deepfake detection. Each model captured different aspects of synthetic artifacts: Xception excelled in spatial inconsistency detection through depthwise separable convolutions, Custom CNN provided domain-specific feature extraction optimized for forensic analysis, EfficientNet offered balanced multi-scale analysis, and ResNet50, despite lower individual performance, contributed unique perspectives that enhanced overall robustness.

The relatively balanced weight distribution (ranging from 0.234 to 0.258) suggests that all models provided valuable contributions, supporting the diversity principle in ensemble learning \cite{brown2005diversity}. Even ResNet50, with the lowest individual accuracy, received substantial weight (0.234), indicating that its errors were sufficiently different from other models to provide corrective value.

The error reduction analysis reveals the ensemble's ability to address different failure modes: the 78\% reduction in false negatives suggests that the ensemble effectively captures deepfakes missed by individual models, while the 46.5\% reduction in false positives indicates improved specificity in distinguishing authentic content.

\subsection{Architectural Insights and Feature Complementarity}

The superior performance of Xception aligns with theoretical expectations, as depthwise separable convolutions can effectively capture the spatial inconsistencies characteristic of deepfake generation processes. The separation of spatial and channel-wise processing may be particularly relevant for detecting artifacts that manifest differently across color channels.

The surprisingly strong performance of the Custom CNN (98.81\%) challenges the assumption that transfer learning always provides superior results. This finding suggests that domain-specific architectural design, informed by the characteristics of forensic applications, can compete with sophisticated pre-trained models. The Custom CNN's hierarchical feature extraction, explicitly designed for multi-scale artifact detection, appears well-suited to the deepfake detection task.

EfficientNet's balanced performance reflects its compound scaling methodology, which systematically optimizes all architectural dimensions. This balanced approach may be particularly valuable for deepfake detection, where optimal performance requires careful consideration of spatial resolution, network depth, and feature diversity.

\subsection{Generalization Challenges and Domain Overfitting}

The dramatic performance degradation in cross-dataset evaluation (99.64\% to 50\%) reveals a critical limitation in current deepfake detection approaches. This finding suggests that models learned to detect StyleGAN-specific artifacts rather than generalizable deepfake characteristics. The uniform degradation across all architectures, including the ensemble, indicates that this limitation is fundamental rather than architecture-specific.

This domain overfitting phenomenon has significant implications for real-world deployment. Deepfake detection systems that perform excellently on curated datasets may fail catastrophically when confronted with new generation techniques or different preprocessing pipelines. The arms race between generation and detection technologies exacerbates this challenge, as detection systems must adapt to rapidly evolving synthesis methods.

The cross-dataset results emphasize the critical importance of diverse training data encompassing multiple generation techniques, quality levels, and post-processing variations. Current evaluation practices, which primarily rely on single-dataset assessment, may significantly overestimate real-world performance.

\subsection{Practical Implications and Deployment Considerations}

The ensemble approach presents trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. While the 4Ã— increase in inference time may be prohibitive for real-time applications, the significant error reduction could justify this overhead in security-critical scenarios. The 78\% reduction in false negatives is particularly valuable in applications where missing deepfakes has severe consequences, such as disinformation detection or legal evidence verification.

For practical deployment, the ensemble could be implemented with dynamic model selection based on input characteristics or confidence scores. This approach might provide ensemble benefits while reducing computational overhead in cases where individual models exhibit high confidence.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Directions}

This study has several limitations that provide directions for future research. First, the evaluation was conducted primarily on facial deepfakes, and generalization to other synthetic media (voice, full-body) remains unexplored. Second, the cross-dataset evaluation revealed severe generalization limitations that require systematic investigation across multiple generation techniques and quality levels.

Future work should focus on developing training strategies that improve cross-domain generalization, such as domain adaptation techniques, adversarial training with multiple generation methods, and meta-learning approaches that enable rapid adaptation to new synthesis techniques. Additionally, investigating dynamic ensemble methods that adapt to input characteristics could improve the efficiency-accuracy trade-off.

The development of standardized evaluation protocols for deepfake detection, including comprehensive cross-dataset benchmarks and real-world deployment scenarios, is crucial for advancing the field beyond laboratory demonstrations toward practical applications. Recent work by Yan et al. \cite{yan2023deepfakebench} introduces DeepfakeBench, a unified evaluation framework containing 15 detection methods across 9 datasets with standardized metrics, highlighting the importance of consistent evaluation protocols. Furthermore, the integration of interpretable AI approaches \cite{du2024taenet} that provide visual evidence of detection decisions will be essential for building trust and enabling forensic applications where explainability is paramount.

\section{Conclusion}

This study demonstrates that weighted averaging ensembles can effectively improve deepfake detection performance by leveraging the complementary strengths of diverse deep learning architectures. Our approach achieved 99.64\% accuracy on the 140k Real and Fake Faces dataset, representing significant improvements over individual models in both accuracy and error reduction. The ensemble reduced false negatives by 78\% and false positives by 46.5\%, addressing critical failure modes in deepfake detection systems.

However, cross-dataset evaluation revealed severe generalization challenges, with performance degrading to random-guessing levels (50\%) on external datasets. This finding highlights the critical gap between laboratory performance and real-world applicability, emphasizing the urgent need for diverse training strategies and robust evaluation protocols.

The key contributions of this work include: (1) systematic demonstration of ensemble effectiveness for deepfake detection, (2) comprehensive analysis of model complementarity and error patterns, (3) identification of critical generalization limitations through cross-dataset evaluation, and (4) practical insights for deployment considerations and future research directions.

Future research should prioritize the development of training methodologies that improve cross-domain generalization, such as multi-dataset training, domain adaptation techniques, and adversarial robustness methods. Additionally, the investigation of dynamic ensemble approaches and efficient architectures will be crucial for enabling practical deployment in real-world applications where computational resources and latency constraints are significant considerations.
